06:09:06 [INFO] 邮件内容："> In many tests, it never completes, the top right corner always says \"Fetching completion...\" and rust-ana's completion function fails. The completion function of rust-ana also failed. But when I was about to give up, I opened it once and suddenly everything worked again, all completions were completed, I can't guess why this happened!\n\nNot sure what's going on then. If you can find a way to reproduce let me know but I'll keep an eye on this anyway.\n\n-- \nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/leona/helix-gpt/issues/13#issuecomment-1916085784\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\nMessage ID: <leona/helix-gpt/issues/13/1916085784@github.com>"
